# FRC Team 1014 _Bad Robots_: 2024 Code

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the 2024 code of FRC Team 1014, _Bad Robots_! This guide will help you get started with running, editing, and formatting the code for the robot.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before you can work with the code, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary software installed on your computer:

1. **WPILib VSCode**: This is the development environment for FRC teams. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases).
2. **Java Tools**: Make sure you have Java tools installed on your computer. You can find more information on how to set up Java tools for Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java).
3. **FRC Game Tools**: Unfortunately, this is only available for Windows users. You can download it from [here](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html). This is required for running the code on the robot.

### Running the Code

Once you have the necessary tools installed, follow these steps to run the code on your robot:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Get a copy of the code repository onto your computer.

2. **Connect to the Robot**: You can connect to the robot using one of the following methods:

   - Wireless connection
   - Wired Ethernet connection

3. **Deploy the Code**: In Visual Studio Code, press `ctrl + shift + p`, then type `Deploy Robot Code` and press Enter. This will deploy the code to your robot.

4. **Launch Driver Station and Shuffleboard**: Open the FRC Driver Station and Shuffleboard tools to control and monitor your robot.

5. **Drive the Robot!**: You're all set to drive the robot using the deployed code.
